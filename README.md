# Tubular_Sector

This is a space shooter based in two old games, Tempest and Gyruss, that im doing while i learn more of Unity.

While im a fan of 2D, i tought to start this project on 3D, since these old games had the 3D vibe on them.

Bringing the basic files of this project, we have our cube "ships" for the player and some enemies spinning on the scene.

We can rotate, shoot and destroy the enemies, i would like to do this project with unity only, but we will see. I'm already thinking in using blender to change the ships, and probably gonna get a free skybox soon to get rid of the blue horizon.

The old Gyruss had the enemy ships doing a sort of "ballet" when entering the scene... So a spawner with dancing ships is something im thinking to do next.

Well, so far so good. Going to focus on a bootcamp and back to spaceships in the weekend.
