# Tubular_Sector

This is a space shooter based in two old games, Tempest and Gyruss, that im doing while i learn more of Unity.

While im a fan of 2D, i tought to start this project on 3D, since these old games had the 3D vibe on them.

For now is just this. The repo, time constraints and all that stuff. Let's hope that tomorrow i get the first files here.
